# Engineering & Analytics: An Uber Data Expedition

Introduction:
In this project, I built a data model and wrote transformation code in Python, deploying it on a Google Cloud compute instance. Installed and used Mage, an open-source data pipeline tool, to load data into BigQuery. Used SQL to query the data and create a final dashboard to answer key questions.
